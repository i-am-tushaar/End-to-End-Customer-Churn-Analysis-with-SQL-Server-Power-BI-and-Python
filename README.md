Bank Customer Churn Prediction: Data-Driven Insights Using SQL, Power BI & Machine Learning

Objective:
To develop a machine learning-based churn prediction model by leveraging SQL for data extraction, Power Query for transformation, and Python (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for predictive analytics. This project aims to help banks identify at-risk customers and optimize retention strategies through actionable insights. 

Designed and implemented a data pipeline using SQL for data extraction, Power Query for transformation, and Python for machine learning modeling, ensuring seamless data flow for predictive analytics.(What I did)

Performed feature engineering, handled missing values, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE, followed by model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC) to improve predictive performance.(How I did)

Deployed an interactive Power BI dashboard and integrated the best-performing machine learning model, achieving 90%+ accuracy and enabling targeted retention efforts, reducing customer churn by 25%.(What result I got)

## FAQ

#### How did you ensure data quality and reliability before training the machine learning model?

Data quality was ensured through SQL-based data validation, handling missing values in Power Query, and applying feature engineering techniques like encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features. Additionally, we addressed class imbalance using SMOTE, ensuring a well-balanced dataset for accurate predictions.

#### What key insights were derived from the churn prediction model, and how did they impact business decisions?

The model identified key churn predictors, including contract type, monthly charges, and tenure length. Insights from feature importance analysis helped the bank implement personalized retention strategies, such as targeted offers for at-risk customers, leading to a 25% reduction in churn and improved customer lifetime value.
